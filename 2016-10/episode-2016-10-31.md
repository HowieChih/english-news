French authorities began clearing the "Jungle", a migrants' camp in Calais, but on the first day were only able to bus 1, 500 - 2, 000 of the more than 7, 000 residents to accommodation centers elsewhere in France. A small minority of those who remained set fire to toilet blocks, threw stones **at** police and said they would not go willingly.
