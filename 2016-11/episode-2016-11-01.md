BHS (British Home Stores), a heavily indebted retail chain, was expected to go into administration today, risking 11,000 jobs. The company's pension scheme has a £ 571m deficit, and may need to be bailed out. Pensioners have been told to expect cuts. Critics say that the previous management stripped the firm's assets.
