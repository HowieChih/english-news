Hillary Clinton nearly clinched the Democratic presidential nomination. Her rival Bernie Sanders started laying off staff. Donald Trump also did well in five east-coast primaries, but needs more big wins, notably in Indiana on Tuesday, for victory before the Republican convention in Cleveland in July. The other contenders, John Kasich and Ted Cruz, struck a tactical deal against him.
