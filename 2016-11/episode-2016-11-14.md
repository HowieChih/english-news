Donald Trump won America's presidential election, wrongfooting the predictions of pundits and pollsters and winning states that had voted Democrat for decades but where voters were receptive to his populist（民粹的） pledges. The shock result convulsed the markets but they bounced back after Mr Trump gave a conciliatory（温和的） victory speech. His defeated rival Hillary Clinton urged Americans to unite behind him.
