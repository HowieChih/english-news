Colombia announced a new peace deal with the FARC（哥伦比亚革命武装力量）, six weeks after the original agreement was rejected in a referendum（全民公投）. The changes include a commitment by the guerrillas（游击队） to declare and hand over their assests, which will be used to compensate victims of the 52-year conflict. The revised deal may be put to a vote in Congress without another plebiscite（公投）.
