The European Commission told eight members of the euro zone（欧元区） that their excessive budget deficits may soon break EU fiscal rules, which limit allowable defictis to 3% of GDP. Among those warned were Italy, Spain and Portugal, though the commission said that in Italy's case the extra costs of dealing with earthquakes and surging migration would be taken into account.
