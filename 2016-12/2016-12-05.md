Fidel Castro died, aged 90. The Cuban Communist leader ruled the island for 47 years, ceding power to his brother Raúl in 2006. Revered on the revolutionary left, he survived numerous American assassination attempts, and six presidents（美国六任总统）. His rule was notable for health-care and education, political repression—and marathon speeches, including a record four hours 29 minutes at the UN.
