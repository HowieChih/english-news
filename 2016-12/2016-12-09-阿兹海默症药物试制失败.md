Eli Lilly said that a clinical trial for a new drug to slow the onset of Alzheimer's（老年痴呆症） had failed. The drug, solanezumab, was tested on patients with mild cases of Alzheimer's, who showed only a slight improvement after 18 months of treatment. The experiment had been closely watched by medical researchers and **hopes were high** that solanezumab would be the first drug approved to treat the disease.
