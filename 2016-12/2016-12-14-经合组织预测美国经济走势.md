The OECD gave the thumbs up to Donald Trump's plan to boost infrastructure spending, saying it would boost America's economy. But the organization also warned that "an increase in protectionism could risk impairing already weak growth in global trade". Meanwhile, America's economic growth rate in the third quarter was revised to an annualized 3.2%, up from an initial estimate of 2.9%.
