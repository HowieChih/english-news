Netflix, which streams video, added 370,000 subscribers in America in the third quarter and 3.2 m elsewhere. Both results were far better than it has forecast (although the growth of its American subscriptions has slowed compared with a year earlier). The firm's volatile share price, which had fallen by 13% this year ahead of the news, jumped by almost 20% immediately after it.
