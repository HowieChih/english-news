In a decision vehemently opposed by some ministers, British's Conservative government approved a controversial expansion of Heathrow airport that will add a third runway **at cost of** ￡ 18bn. The plan for Heathrow, west of London, beat a rival proposal to build a second runway at Gatwick airport, south of the capital. The project is expected to face numerous legal challenges.
