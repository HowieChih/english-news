difference between structure and constructure

The two words do basically have the same meaning, however, "constructure" is a fairly new word and is only really ever used in the engineering field or the architecture field. I almost never hear this word being used in any other than this very highly specific and academic context. So, make sure you use "structure" every time and you'll be fine!
